# brnfck
A small brainfuck interpreter/editor

editor+interpreter.c is dependent on lib.h and in beta

brnfck43.c and functions4.h form the alpha version, and interprets brnfck4, but is backwards compatible with brnfck3 and regular brainfuck

on brainfuck dialects

brnfck3 works the exact same but has 3 more commands

brnfck4 allows certain commands to interpret the next entry as an argument unless it is an argument, based on brnfck3
